            Dat is a nonprofit-backed community & open protocol for building apps of the future. The Dat Project imagines a web of commons created by global communities on open and secure protocols. We set out to improve access to public data and created a new protocol along the way, read more at <a href="https://www.datprotocol.com">datprotocol.com</a>. In our work on developing Dat, we found a under-served need. Decentralized software has potential to return control of digital information to the people. Today, building peer-to-peer applications presents both technical and ethical challenges but Dat is slowly changing that.
          </p>
          <p class="${copyClass}">
            To encourage people to experiment and innovate with decentralized technology, we aim to make Dat foundational software for peer-to-peer applications â€“ one that is sponsored by a mission-driven nonprofit. To realize this future, we aim to make Dat good at supporting the core needs of peer-to-peer applications. We hope that with our small but critical focus, we can create a strong building block for the Dat ecosystem.

            The first code went into Dat <a href="https://github.com/datproject/dat/commit/e5eda57b53f60b05c0c3d97da90c10cd17dcbe19">on August 17, 2013</a>. Throughout its history, Dat has had a primary focus on Dat sharing in civic data and research, only recently with a wider focus on more general decentralized applications. Dat has been almost exclusively funded by grants from private foundations, <a href="https://blog.datproject.org/2017/09/15/dat-funding-history"/>read more on the funding history</a>.
